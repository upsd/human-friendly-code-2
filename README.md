# Human Friendly Code #2 - Football Match
This project demonstrates refactoring code so it is much easier for humans (developers) to understand and make changes to if required.

## The scenario
The program's purpose is to record the score of a football match.

For instance:

`Given` the score is 0-0

`When` the home team scores a goal

`Then` the score is now 1-0
